        <h2>Developing Job Assignment Algorithms</h2>
        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt class="methodName">runJobAssignment(eesa.core.JobSet js, eesa.core. Processor[] processors)</dt>
            <dd>This algorithm performs the assignment.<br /> 
                You are passed the JobSet, on which <span class="methodName">getJobs()</span> 
                can be called to retrieve all the Jobs. 
                The second argument provides you will an array list of all the processors.
                The return value is a set of ProcessorResult[] objects each of 
                which should be constructed as follows, to ensure they are 
                attached to a processor:
                <pre>ProcessorResult procResult = new ProcessorResult(processor)</pre>
                If your algorithm has specific conditions regarding the jobs or 
                encounters an error, it is acceptable to throw a 
                <span class="className">eesa.exceptions.AlgorithmException</span>
                (which should be constructed with a 
                <span class="className">java.lang.String</span> message 
                detailing the problem for the user. This will be presented 
                accordingly by the UI.
            </dd>
            <dd><strong>Return Type:</strong> <span class="className">eesa.core.ProcessorResult[]</span></dd>            
            <dt class="methodName">toString()</dt>
            <dd>Although a default version of this is created by Java, it is a 
                good idea to override this. It is used as the name of the 
                algorithm in multiple locations, such as when selecting algorithms.</dd>
            <dd><strong>Return Type:</strong> <span class="className">java.lang.String</span></dd>
            <dt class="methodName">getDescription()</dt>
            <dd>This returns a long description of the algorithm. Things 
                commonly included here are the paper in which it was first 
                described, the authors and remarks on running time and optimality.</dd>
