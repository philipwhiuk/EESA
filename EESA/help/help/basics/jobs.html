        <h2>Jobs</h2>    
        Jobs are perhaps the most important part of the system. 
        They represent an amount of work to be done by a <a href="">processor</a> 
        and having the following characteristics:
        <ul>
            <li>Arrival Time</li>
            <li>Deadline Time</li>
            <li>Weight</li>
        </ul>
        From these basic properties, 2 others can be calculated:
        <ul>
            <li>Length [Deadline - Arrival]</li>
            <li>Density [Weight / Length]</li>
        </ul>
        Jobs can be added to the system by using the <a href="">Add Job Window</a> 
        as well as by <a href="">generating them</a> and <a href="">importing them</a> 
        from other sources.
        <h3>Results</h3>
        When a simulation is run, each test must assign each job to one of the 
        processors. This process of Job Assignment is handled by the selected 
        <a href="">Job Assignment Algorithm</a>.
        <p>
        The results of this process are then shown on the 
        <a href="">Results Data Panel</a>, which provides tabulated data and 
        visualisations of the results of the tests performed.</p>
