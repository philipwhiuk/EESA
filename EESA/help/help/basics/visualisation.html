        <h2>Visualisation</h2>
        A key component of the system is the ability to view data, both before 
        and after running the algorithms. This is done in two forms:
        <ul>
            <li>Tabulated Data</li>
            <li>Charts</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Data Tables</h3>
        <p>The tables in the system are designed to allow the user to manipulate 
            them. Clicking on column headings allows the user to sort them.</p>
        <p>The <a href="">Jobs</a> table also allows field-based filtering using 
                comparison operators.</p>
        <p>The <a href="">Job Results</a> and <a href="">Time Periods</a> tables 
            allow filtering by <a href="tests.html">Test</a> and 
            <a href="processors.html">Processor</a>.</p>
        <h3>Charts</h3>
        <p>There are three types of data output chart which allow viewing of 
            results in different ways. Each chart is also filtered by the same 
            controls as the output charts and can be split into smaller charts 
            via certain options. Charts will automatically resize to the window 
            and data values.</p>
        <p>The <a href="">Job Chart</a> shows the time-line of the allocated job 
            results.</p>
        <p><a href="">Speed Charts</a> and <a href="">Energy Charts</a> show the 
            energy usage in each time period.</p>
