EESA
====

For my final year project at Loughborough University I developed a simulator of
deadline-based processor scheduling algorithms. The modular system is cross-platform
and built in Java. It implements published algorithms for speed scaling and job assignment.
The linked dissertation covers the development process.

EESA is programmed in Java, specifically the Standard Edition. 
As such it wonâ€™t run on mobiles even those that support Java ME. Desktop-based users should
download the Java Standard Edition from java.com. Versions may be released as executables,
native apps or on other platforms in the future.
