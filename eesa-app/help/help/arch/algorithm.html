        <h2>Algorithm Loading</h2>
        <p>The simulator allows additional algorithms to be loaded. To develop an algorithm a number of steps must be followed.</p>
        <p>Assuming you are using an IDE to develop the algorithm:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a Java Project</li>
            <li>Add 'EESA-Core' as a project library</li>
            <li>Create a new class for each algorithm, implementing the desired Algorithm interface 
                (<span class="className">eesa.core.JobAssignmentAlgorithm</span> or <span class="className">eesa.core.SpeedScalingAlgorithm</span>).</li>
            <li>Compile the project into a JAR file</li>
            <li>Place the .jar file in the directly in which EESA is installed</li>
            <li>Append the .jar file to the list in the <span class="fileName">EESA.bat</span> file</li> 
            <li>Append the name of the algorithm(s) to the related <span class="fileName">.dat</span> file in the properties folder</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The algorithm will then be loaded and can be used as normal.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> You may include other libraries (but remember to add them to 
            .bat file and folder). However do not rely on other EESA modules 
            (such as the GUI) as future updates will not attempt to maintain 
            backwards compatability for the purposes of algorithm support.
        <p>If you make an error in one of the steps, the simulator will inform you (to the best of it's ability) either via a warning window, or in the log files.</p>
