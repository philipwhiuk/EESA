        The outcome of running the tests is sets of results. This is produced in 
        two separate types:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="">Job Results</a> show the processor on which each job 
                runs.</li>
            <li><a href="">Time Periods</a> show the speed at which each 
                processor was ran during each period of time.</li>
        </ul>
        These results are shown in various 
        <a href="visualisations.html">visualisations</a> to aid understanding. 
        Results may also be <a href="">exported</a> from the system in various 
        formats.
