        <h2>Tests</h2>
        <p>Tests are pairs of algorithms which are run against the set of 
            <a href="jobs.html">jobs</a> to produce results. During this process 
        the tests's two algorithms are run sequentially:</p>
        <p>Firstly the <a href="">Job Assignment Algorithm</a> runs and 
            determines which processor each job should be assigned to.</p>
        <p>Next the <a href="">Speed Scaling Algorithm</a> is run on each 
            processor to determine the speed and order in which each job is run.</p>
