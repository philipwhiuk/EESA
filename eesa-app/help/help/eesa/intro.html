        <div>The Energy-Efficient Scheduling Algorithms (EESA) Simulator is Java-based desktop application designed to allow researchers and students to simulate 
            multi-processor deadline scheduling algorithms and develop the field of research. 
            The program was initially developed as a final year project at Loughborough University by Philip Whitehouse.</div>
        <div>This help system provides a point of reference for users. It is supplemented by an online version (which may correct inaccuracies) as well as the documentation generated from the source code. 
            The intention of the help system is both to instruct users in how to use the software as well as how future modifications and changes can be made. 
            In this way it acts as a stepping stone to the Javadoc documentation which provides the definitive details required to implement features.</div>
        <div>Although the project source may of course be cited directly, a better reference in most cases is the project report published alongside this project which provides a run-down of the development process.</div>
