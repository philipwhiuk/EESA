<title>Energy Efficient Scheduling Algorithms (EESA) Simulator</title>
</head>
<body>
This documentation covers the Java packages which implement a simulator of 
Energy Efficient Scheduling Algorithms.
<p>Initially developed as final year project at Loughborough University to 
simulate and visualise deadline-based processor scheduling algorithms 
it has since been expanded to cover more generic energy-efficient 
scheduling algorithms. It currently implements a small selection of 
published algorithms for speed scaling and job assignment.
</p>
<p>The core classes covering the {@link eesa.core.Job}s executed are found in 
{@link eesa.core}.</p>
<p>An implementation of a graphical user interface is found in the 
{@link eesa.gui} packages, including usage of JavaHelp ({@link eesa.gui.javahelp}).
</p>
<p>The {@link eesa.xml} packages provides standard storage (loading and saving). 
In addition,
along with {@link eesa.csv} and the {@link eesa.db} packages, it provides an 
option for importing and exporting to a flexible schema.</p>
<p>Currently the visualisation is limited to a small selection of graphs. 
Improving the flexibility and existing graphs is an ongoing area of work.</p>
